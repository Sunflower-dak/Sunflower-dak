- 👋 Hi, I’m Kwaku 
- 👀 I’m interested in Human Capital Development. I have startup into that btw. Check we out on every social media platform @/ TiBi Career Coterie.
- 🌱 I’m currently taking lessons on html and other frontend stacks. I am not learning to be a developer. I just want to understand the rudiment of building systems with various stacks to have a deep knowledge on how to manage developers and direct my team while  managing any project. I dont know if I am making sense😂😂
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open source repositories that are focused on Human Capital Development or education.
- 📫 How to reach me: My twitter & Instagram = "@/ Sunflower.dak", My LinkedIn = "Kwaku Asetena-Krah"
